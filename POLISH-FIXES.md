# Final Polish Fixes

## Date: October 1, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Last Trick Cards Disappearing Too Quickly
**Issue:** When the last trick of a round completes, cards immediately disappear and jump to the next round, not giving players time to see the results.

**Root Cause:** `ROUND_TRANSITION_DELAY_MS` was set to only 200ms (0.2 seconds).

**Fix:** Increased to 10 seconds to match the delay between tricks within a round.

**File Changed:** `backend/src/socket/roomHandlers.js`
```javascript
// Before
const ROUND_TRANSITION_DELAY_MS = 200;

// After
const ROUND_TRANSITION_DELAY_MS = 10000; // 10 seconds to view final trick before next round
```

**Impact:** 
- Players now have 10 seconds to view the final trick results
- Consistent timing with regular trick-to-trick transitions
- Better UX for understanding round outcomes

### 2. ✅ Timer Not Ticking Down
**Issue:** The turn timer displays a static time and doesn't count down in real-time.

**Root Cause:** Timer was only updated when state changed (on render), but there was no interval timer continuously updating the display.

**Fix:** Added a `setInterval` that updates the timer display every 100ms for smooth countdown.

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/modules/gameUI/gameBoard.js`

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Timer update interval
let timerInterval = null;
const startTimerInterval = () => {
  if (timerInterval) {
    clearInterval(timerInterval);
  }
  timerInterval = setInterval(() => {
    const state = store.getState();
    if (timerEl && state.turnEndsAt) {
      const seconds = clampSeconds(state.turnEndsAt);
      timerEl.textContent = formatSeconds(seconds);
    }
  }, 100); // Update every 100ms for smooth countdown
};
```

**Features:**
- Updates every 100ms (10 times per second) for smooth visual countdown
- Automatically starts when a deadline is set
- Automatically stops when deadline is cleared or component is hidden
- Properly cleaned up on component destroy

**Impact:**
- Real-time countdown visible to players
- Creates urgency as time runs out
- Better game flow awareness

### 3. ✅ Redundant Vira Card Text
**Issue:** The vira label showed redundant information like "Vira 6♦ · Manilha: 7" when the card is already visually displayed.

**Fix:** Simplified to show only "Manilha: 7" since the card itself is visible.

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/modules/gameUI/gameBoard.js`

```javascript
// Before
viraLabel.textContent = manilhaRank ? `Vira ${label} · Manilha: ${manilhaRank}` : `Vira ${label}`;

// After
viraLabel.textContent = manilhaRank ? `Manilha: ${manilhaRank}` : 'Vira';
```

**Impact:**
- Cleaner, less cluttered UI
- Removes redundant information
- Players can clearly see the vira card and just need the manilha rank

## Testing Checklist

### Timer Testing
- [ ] Start a game and enter bidding phase
- [ ] Verify timer shows countdown (e.g., "10.0s", "9.9s", "9.8s"...)
- [ ] Verify it counts down smoothly
- [ ] Verify it shows "—" when no timer is active

### Last Trick Delay Testing
- [ ] Play through to round 2 or 3 (multi-trick rounds)
- [ ] Complete trick 1 - should wait 10 seconds before trick 2 starts
- [ ] Complete the last trick of the round
- [ ] Verify cards stay visible for ~10 seconds before next round starts
- [ ] Verify you have time to see who won the last trick

### Vira Display Testing
- [ ] Check that vira section shows the card visually
- [ ] Check that label shows only "Manilha: X" format
- [ ] Verify it's clear which rank is the manilha

## Technical Details

### Timer Implementation Notes
- Uses `setInterval` with 100ms interval for smooth updates
- Interval is stored in closure and properly cleaned up
- Only runs when component is visible and deadline exists
- Prevents memory leaks by clearing interval on destroy
- Display formats differently for <10s (shows decimal) vs ≥10s (rounds to integer)

### Round Transition Timing
- **Within round** (trick to trick): 10 seconds (`TRICK_START_DELAY_MS`)
- **Between rounds**: Now 10 seconds (`ROUND_TRANSITION_DELAY_MS`) - was 200ms
- Both use same delay for consistent UX
- Can be overridden via `room.hostSettings.roundTransitionDelayMs` if needed

### Display Optimization
- Removed redundant text reduces visual noise
- Card is self-explanatory when visible
- Label provides only essential supplementary info (manilha rank)

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. `backend/src/socket/roomHandlers.js`
   - Increased `ROUND_TRANSITION_DELAY_MS` from 200ms to 10000ms

### Frontend
1. `frontend/src/modules/gameUI/gameBoard.js`
   - Added timer interval for real-time countdown
   - Simplified vira label text
   - Added proper cleanup in destroy method

---

## Performance Considerations

### Timer Interval
- 100ms interval = 10 updates/second
- Minimal CPU impact
- Only runs when game board is visible
- Single interval for entire component (not per-player or per-element)
- Automatically stops when not needed

### Round Transition
- 10-second delay adds to game length but improves UX
- Players need time to:
  - See final trick winner
  - Process round results
  - Mentally prepare for next round
- Matches existing trick-to-trick timing

---

## Future Enhancements

Consider:
1. Make delays configurable in host settings
2. Add visual indication when waiting for next round
3. Add progress bar showing time until next action
4. Animate the timer color as it approaches zero (e.g., yellow → red)
5. Add sound/haptic feedback when timer reaches low thresholds
