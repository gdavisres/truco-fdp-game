# Backend Modules

Modular backend implementation for the Truco FDP Game. Each subdirectory represents a focused domain module:

- `gameLogic/`: Pure gameplay rules and calculations
- `roomManager/`: Player session and room lifecycle management
- `cardEngine/`: Card entities, deck operations, and shuffling utilities
- `stateManager/`: Persistence, snapshots, and recovery workflows
