# Security Audit & Implementation Plan

## Current Security Status

### ✅ Existing Security Measures

1. **Input Validation**
   - Display name validation (3-20 chars, alphanumeric with spaces) via DISPLAY_NAME_REGEX
   - Room ID validation against whitelist (5 Brazilian cities)
   - Chat message sanitization with length limits (MAX_CHAT_MESSAGE_LENGTH)
   - Payload type validation in socket handlers
   - Game action validation (bid validation, card play validation)
   - Phase transition validation in GameState

2. **Server-Authoritative Game Logic**
   - All game actions validated on server
   - Card dealing uses cryptographic randomness (crypto.randomBytes)
   - Trick resolution on server
   - Score calculation on server
   - Turn order enforcement on server

3. **Basic Session Management**
   - Session tracking with sessionId
   - Player reconnection with 5-minute window
   - Socket.io connection state management

### ❌ Missing Security Measures

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - ❌ No global rate limiting on socket events
   - ⚠️ Minimal chat rate limiting exists but needs enhancement
   - ❌ No rate limiting on join attempts
   - ❌ No rate limiting on game actions (bid, play_card)

2. **Advanced Input Validation**
   - ❌ No XSS protection for chat messages (beyond basic sanitization)
   - ❌ No SQL injection protection (not applicable - no SQL, but principle applies)
   - ❌ No payload size limits enforcement
   - ❌ No regex DoS protection

3. **Anti-Cheat Validation**
   - ✅ Server validates all game actions
   - ⚠️ Need explicit verification that clients can't see hidden information
   - ❌ No detection of rapid-fire invalid actions (potential bot detection)
   - ❌ No logging of suspicious behavior patterns

4. **Security Headers & Configuration**
   - ❌ No CORS configuration documented
   - ❌ No Content Security Policy
   - ❌ No security-related HTTP headers (Helmet.js)

## Improvement Priorities

### HIGH Priority

1. **Rate Limiting System**
   - Implement per-socket rate limiting for all socket events
   - Add exponential backoff for repeated violations
   - Track rate limit violations per IP/socket
   - Configure different limits for different event types:
     * join_room: 5 per minute
     * chat_message: 10 per minute
     * submit_bid: 1 per turn (enforced by game logic)
     * play_card: 1 per turn (enforced by game logic)
     * leave_room: 3 per minute

2. **Enhanced Input Validation**
   - Add HTML/XSS sanitization for all text inputs
   - Implement payload size limits (max 1KB per message)
   - Add validation middleware for all socket events
   - Validate data types and ranges for all inputs

3. **Anti-Cheat Enhancements**
   - Add server-side verification that players can't see hidden cards
   - Log suspicious action patterns (rapid invalid actions)
   - Add timing analysis for impossible actions
   - Track and alert on repeated validation failures

### MEDIUM Priority

4. **Security Configuration**
   - Add Helmet.js for HTTP security headers
   - Configure CORS properly for production
   - Add CSP headers
   - Document security configuration

5. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all security events (rate limits, validation failures)
   - Add security event aggregation
   - Create security monitoring dashboard data

### LOW Priority

6. **Advanced Anti-Cheat**
   - Add behavior analysis for bot detection
   - Implement honeypot fields
   - Add CAPTCHA for suspicious patterns (future enhancement)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Rate Limiting (30 minutes)
1. Create rate limiting middleware for Socket.io
2. Implement token bucket algorithm per socket
3. Add configurable limits per event type
4. Integrate into existing socket handlers
5. Add rate limit violation logging
6. Write tests for rate limiting

### Phase 2: Enhanced Validation (30 minutes)
1. Create validation middleware module
2. Add XSS sanitization for chat messages
3. Add payload size validation
4. Add type validation helpers
5. Integrate validation into all socket handlers
6. Write tests for validation

### Phase 3: Anti-Cheat Verification (20 minutes)
1. Add explicit card visibility verification
2. Add suspicious action logging
3. Create action timing validation
4. Add repeated failure detection
5. Write tests for anti-cheat

### Phase 4: Security Headers (10 minutes)
1. Add Helmet.js to Express app
2. Configure CORS properly
3. Add CSP headers
4. Document security configuration

### Phase 5: Documentation (10 minutes)
1. Document all security measures
2. Create security best practices guide
3. Add security testing scenarios
4. Update deployment documentation

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Rate limiting active on all socket events with appropriate limits
- ✅ No XSS vulnerabilities in chat system
- ✅ All game actions validated server-side with explicit verification
- ✅ Security headers properly configured (A rating on securityheaders.com)
- ✅ Comprehensive security logging in place
- ✅ All security measures documented
- ✅ Security tests passing (unit + integration)

## Security Testing Checklist

### Rate Limiting Tests
- [ ] Verify rate limits enforced per event type
- [ ] Test exponential backoff for violations
- [ ] Verify legitimate users not affected
- [ ] Test rate limit reset after cooldown

### Input Validation Tests
- [ ] Test XSS injection attempts blocked
- [ ] Test oversized payloads rejected
- [ ] Test malformed payloads handled gracefully
- [ ] Test boundary conditions (empty, null, undefined)

### Anti-Cheat Tests
- [ ] Verify players can't see hidden cards
- [ ] Test invalid action detection
- [ ] Test timing validation
- [ ] Test repeated failure tracking

### Security Headers Tests
- [ ] Verify Helmet headers present
- [ ] Test CORS configuration
- [ ] Verify CSP headers
- [ ] Test in production environment

## Known Security Limitations

1. **No Authentication/Authorization**: By design (no registration requirement)
2. **No Rate Limiting by IP**: Currently per-socket only (IP tracking requires proxy configuration)
3. **No Persistent Ban System**: Bans only last for session duration
4. **No CAPTCHA**: May be needed if bot activity becomes an issue
5. **No DDoS Protection**: Requires infrastructure-level solution (Cloudflare, AWS Shield)

These limitations are acceptable for the current MVP scope but should be considered for future enhancements if the game gains significant traction.
